find the best way to add files while program is running
make sure you can read files in subfolder (just restrict it to .mp4 files)
shouldn't zoom on double click
need saved clips to persist and have a way to delete from list
currently can't add new files as the association list doesn't update
use subfolders of vods/ to make playlists
make a button to switch between filelist and savedlist, so you  can have saved clips as a playlists
add a way to both save clips and just timestamp? Maybe saved clips and timestamps go in different lists?
