playlists look fine so far.... BUT TO BE CONTINUED
make a playlist tree with the subfolders of vods
playlists don't update themselves at the same time as links
need saved clips to persist and have a way to delete from list
random times are clunky, it takes one extra random to adjust itself to the proper time
The call cycle when loading the page isn't great since we fetch the list, then setplaying, which then refetches the list
