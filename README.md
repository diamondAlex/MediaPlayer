# MediaPlayer
Simple media player. Plays mp4. Can shuffle list, play random videos at random times, save timestamps.
Playlists are displayed according to the videos' folder structure.

To run it, add a folder named 'vods' to the root directory, either fill it with videos or use it as a 
symlink (ln -s /path/to/your/vods vods) and run yarn start.
